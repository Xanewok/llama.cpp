# Brief for Codex (gpt-6.1-sol) working on the Swift 1.5 / 2x RTX 5060 Ti llama.cpp stack

Project: serve UkisAI Swift 1.5 (Qwen3.8-27B hybrid GDN + full attention, MTP head) on 2x RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB with
`-sm tensor` (meta backend, internal AllReduce, NCCL off), speculative MTP k=3, probabilistic draft + rejection verify.
Base of all work: fork commit 68d99c67d (branch `stack-resync-fmq/2026-09-30` on Xanewok/llama.cpp).
Background reports (read-only, read them before designing): `SP/gpu-sampling/REPORT.md`, `SP/gpu-sampling/items/96b-attrib.md`,
`SP/patchA/REPORT.md` (sections 1 and 6 break down the host time per MTP round), `SP/codex-reviews/patchA.txt`.
SP = /home/xanewok/.cache/claude-code-tmp/claude-1000/-home-xanewok-repos-qwen38-eval/93663eaa-5db0-437a-ac16-7d725d755e5b/scratchpad

The MTP round (stack, `-sm tensor`, measured, trimmed steady rounds): V (verify, 4 rows) -> C (catch-up) -> D1 -> D2 -> D3,
~34.5 ms. Host gaps with both GPUs idle ~3.3 ms/round: C->D1 1.22, V->C 1.09, each D gap ~0.24 (0.15 of it ~14 small H2D input
copies + per-GPU syncs). Every host ms is exposed (AllReduce pool of 2 stops the host from running ahead).

## Hard rules (no exceptions)
1. Never run anything on a GPU. Keep `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""` for every command. Do not run llama-server, llama-cli,
   test-backend-ops, compute-sanitizer, nvidia-smi or any CUDA binary. Building CUDA code with nvcc is allowed.
2. Never start a process named `llama-server` (the benchmark harness checks that name). Rename a test server binary if needed.
3. CPU work under `nice -n 19` with at most 8 threads (`-j8`, `-t 8`). Do not compile or run CPU tests while a gpuq depth/perf A/B runs (`gpuq status --brief` shows `RUN` with `depth` or `perf` in the id): host load fakes A/B results; wait for it to end, never bypass a gate. Wrap every compile in `~/repos/qwen38-eval-worktrees/bin/buildgate` with `-j4` (e.g. `~/repos/qwen38-eval-worktrees/bin/buildgate cmake --build build -j4`): other agents build in parallel; it waits for free RAM. ccache is shared across worktrees (keep `GGML_CCACHE=ON`).
4. Write only inside your worktree. Never delete or modify files outside it. No `rm -rf` outside `build*/` dirs of your worktree.
5. No network: no git push, no GitHub/API calls, no posting anywhere, no downloads.
6. Commit to your topic branch only (small, reviewable commits, messages in llama.cpp style, no AI attribution lines).
   Never rewrite other branches.
7. Exactness: any change to sampling must keep the output distribution exact (bit-identical tokens for the same seed, or a
   proven-equivalent law). Add a negative control that fails when the change is broken.
8. Builds: `cmake -B build-cpu -DGGML_CUDA=OFF` for tests; CUDA build `-DGGML_CUDA=ON -DCUDAToolkit_ROOT=/usr/local/cuda-13.2
   -DGGML_CUDA_NCCL=OFF -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=120`. CPU test model: Qwen3.5-4B MTP GGUF, see `SP/patchA/run_cpu.sh`.
9. Label every number: M measured, D derived, G guess. Do not claim GPU speed; propose a GPU A/B script instead.

## Deliverables
- Commits on your topic branch.
- `codex/REPORT.md` in your worktree: conclusion, design, evidence (file:line, tests, commands), CPU numbers, risks, open items.
- `codex/gpu_ab.sh`: a GPU A/B script for the parent to queue (NOT run by you): same frozen-binary pattern as
  `SP/queue/done/99-patchA-graph-cache-ab.sh` (up vs patch, interleaved boots, Xid check, exact-PID stop, budget).
- Final message: only decision-relevant results (conclusion, evidence, failures, uncertainty).

## GPU scripts for the parent (gpuq items)
Any script the parent will queue on the GPUs must satisfy `/home/xanewok/repos/qwen38-eval/orchestration/gpuq/HARNESS-CONTRACT.md`.
Test every parser against a real recorded artifact from `/home/xanewok/repos/qwen38-eval/orchestration/gpuq/fixtures/` (or a
run dir the task names), not only CPU-fixture output. Provide a canary mode (one boot, smallest workload that hits every parser and gate, ≤ 10 min).

- Upstream packages live only in `~/repos/qwen38-eval/patches/upstream/` (index `UPSTREAM.md`). Never create a second package tree. Put package files you author under `codex/upstream/<engine>/<NN>-<slug>/` in your own worktree; the parent merges them. `~/repos/upstream-patches` is a read-only archive.

## Where you work (project rule)
- The parent names your worktree; it lives under `~/repos/qwen38-eval-worktrees/wt/` (created by `bin/wt new`). Read
  `~/repos/qwen38-eval-worktrees/AGENTS.md` and `~/repos/qwen38-eval/AGENTS.md`. Never create `~/repos/<name>` dirs or new
  worktrees yourself; never `git gc|prune|worktree prune` (18 repos borrow `~/repos/llama.cpp` objects).
- Frozen builds: `~/repos/qwen38-eval-worktrees/bin/wt freeze` (writes `frozen/<name>/build/bin`, RUNPATH `$ORIGIN`).

**Commit messages (owner rule, overrides the repository's AGENTS.md "Assisted-by" instruction):** never add `Assisted-by:`, `Co-authored-by:` or any other AI/assistant trailer to a commit message. The owner writes the upstream commit messages and the PR disclosure themselves; local commits carry no attribution.

**CPU model runs (RAM rule):** every CPU run of a model (tests, servers, tools) passes an explicit small context (`-c 4096` unless the task needs more; `n_ctx = 0` means the trained context, 262144 for Qwen3.5 → ~8 GB KV per context). At most one CPU model process at a time, started only while MemAvailable ≥ 10 GiB.

**Heavy CPU work:** start CPU model runs, OMP tests and other multi-core jobs through `~/repos/qwen38-eval-worktrees/bin/cpugate CMD...` (waits while a gpuq measure item runs: host load fakes GPU A/B regressions).

# Task fold-mseq2: the multi-sequence fold does not engage at np1 on the Mac gate — find why and fix

Tree (yours): `~/repos/qwen38-eval-worktrees/wt/fold-mseq` (your previous task: `codex/REPORT-fold-mseq.md`; commits 629a725dd root default-on fold, 538468e53 local A/B switch, 4becd0b27 parent fix: Mac gate RAM threshold 10 → 4 GiB). Same rules as before: no compiles/tests/model runs on this Linux host, no gpuq; Mac via `ssh mini-builder` / your `codex/mseq/run-mac.sh` (one model job at a time, RAM wait ≤ 10 min, each job ≤ 60 min).

## Facts (M)
Parent reran `codex/mseq/run-mac.sh a2` at 04:03 (evidence `codex/mseq/mac-out/a2/`): build OK; `matrix.log`: `m0-np1-kv0-k3-s1729-off rc=0`, `…-on rc=0`, then `FAIL AssertionError(('m0-np1-kv0-k3-s1729', 'no catch-up saved'))`. So with the fold on at np1 the separate catch-up decode still runs (or the judge counts it wrong).

## What
1. Decide whether the fold fails to engage at np1 in the new root commit (a regression vs stack7's one-sequence fold, which engaged on GPU: −0.23/−0.19/−0.22 ms/round) or whether the judge/driver/counter is wrong (e.g. the A/B switch name or polarity in 538468e53, the counter the judge reads, the 4B fixture lacking something stack7's fold needs). Evidence with file:line.
2. Fix (root commit for a real defect, test commit for a judge defect; keep the owner rule: default-on, exact fallback, no env in root series). Rerun the Mac gate a3 and report its full matrix result (np1 + np2 cells, controls).
3. If the gate passes: confirm the window/items still `gpuq submit --check` valid.

Deliverable: append to `codex/REPORT-fold-mseq.md` (section "a3"). Final message: decision-relevant results only.
